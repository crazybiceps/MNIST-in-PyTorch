# MNIST-in-PyTorch
Naive Implementation of PyTorch framework to solve the MNIST-Digit-Recognition-Problem

The Training Dataset can be downloaded from : https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer/download/train.csv

This code is a template that can be used for projects, it imputs a csv file and trains a sequential CNN and ANN model in Pytorch
